<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The
two main reasons I took this class was to jumpstart my learning of modern
programming/scripting languages. As an infrastructure person I used to script
in Bash and VBscript. While bash is very good at
parsing text and output strings and VBscript/Powershell is good at manipulating Microsoft programs They
were both lacking in manipulating data from other sources i.e. webpages, SSH sessions, or third party programs.
The next reason was to meet some good people since I have just moved back to the area after living in Maine for the last
decade or so. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Python
fit the first reason. It has extensive libraries for several types of programs <a
href="http://www.lag.net/paramiko/"><span class=SpellE>paramiko</span></a> for
SSH, <a href="http://twill.idyll.org/">twill</a> for webpages, and <a
href="http://www.perceptiveautomation.com/indigo/index.html">indigo</a>, which
is a very popular home automation software that runs
on OSX. And this just scratches the surface. Also learning some HTML will
help me write a simple web interface for some scripting projects I have at work
so management can utilize the tools I create.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>I
also accomplished the second reason for taking the class. I met some cool
people I wouldn’t have met if I hacked around at home teaching myself. Everyone
was great and I liked working with everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Chad
was a good instructor, and very knowledgeable, He was very helpful and always
available to answer questions. I enjoyed hearing about his developer “war
stories.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The
class was good, I liked that dinner was served. I would come to class straight
from work and I did not have time to get something to eat. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The
main problem I had with the class is that it was too broad. Maybe split off the
Cathedral and the Bazaar into a separate class and spend more time on
programming. As interesting as the discussions were leaving that out might give
us enough time to create a project. Or have some troubleshooting exercises sort
of a “fix this code” assignments. Where chad gave us a webpage and we had to figure out why it wasn’t working as intended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>All
in all it was a great experience I would recommend to anyone that needs to get
up to speed on newer technologies or is learning them for the first time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
